// The ordered set of top-level pages (and their nav labels) for an archetype.
// A route may be content-conditional: FAQ and Portfolio only exist when the
// client actually has that content. That rule lives HERE, once, and is the
// single source of truth shared by:
//   - the header nav (components/sections/header) — which links to render
//   - each route's page.tsx — its notFound() guard (isRouteActive)
// (Home is not listed — it always exists; `dev` is template-only tooling
// excluded from client scaffolds by cli/src/lib/copy-template.ts.)
//
// SCAFFOLD-TIME PRUNING (future): when a second archetype lands, copy-template
// becomes the scaffold-time consumer of ARCHETYPE_ROUTES — it would copy only
// the app/<route> dirs an archetype declares (a commerce site ships /shop, a
// service site does not). That is a no-op with one archetype, so it is left as
// this documented seam rather than built speculatively.
